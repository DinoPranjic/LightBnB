## LighthouseBnB
By Dino Pranjic

LighthouseBnB is a simple take on AirBnB. The purpose of this project is to design a database and use server-side JavaScript to display the information from queries to web pages. It allows users to view booked reservations, create listings for their own properties and search through a database of property listings. 

## Final Product
!["homepage"](https://github.com/DinoPranjic/LightBnB/blob/master/docs/homepage-screenshot.png)
The homepage screen displays properties from the database.

!["My Reservations"](https://github.com/DinoPranjic/LightBnB/blob/master/docs/reservations-screenshot.png)
The "My Reservations" tab lists all reservations currently booked by a user.

!["Create a listing"](https://github.com/DinoPranjic/LightBnB/blob/master/docs/create-listing-screenshot.png)
The "Create Listing" tab allows users to add their own properties to the database.
